    <!--About Me-->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I never saw art as just a form of self-expression. It's a tool to for change. A language without words. 
    A bridge between endless possibilities and reality. Whether it's through graphic design or a marketing campaign,
    my goal is carry my passion for creativity to every digital space.</p>

    <!--About Me (cont'd)-->
    <img src="images/client work 1.jpg" alt="Instagram graphics for a holistic skincare brand called Ativo" style="width:757;height:418"></img>
    <img src="images/client work 2.jpg" alt="Instagram graphics for a local aesthetics clinic called Natology" style="width:757;height:418"></img>
    <p>The best type of work has both of these attributes: funcional and beautiful. <span style="color:violet;">An effective design will always have both.</span>
    Some may argue that this concept can only exist in a perfect world and to that I say: you're thinking too small.
    Like the arms of a scale or the oat milk and sugar in a matcha latte, one cannot be compromised for the sake of the other.
    Finding that delicate balance is the objective of every designer.
